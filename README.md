# IMPACT OF ANATOMICAL DIFFERENCES TOWARDS GENDER BIAS IN PNEUMONIA CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING

In this project we explore methods and techniques to 
- Establish if there is gender bias exhibited by deep learning models while evaluating Chest X-rays
- Verify if anatomical differences between male and female contributes to gender bias
- Expore object detection techniques to separate the ROI i.e lungs and see if the scores improve
